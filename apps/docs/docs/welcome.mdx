Hello there 👋! Welcome to the Docusaurus documentation for nyx, a Discord.js Typescript bot framework.

Here, you'll discover how to create your own bot using nyx, how to customize the framework and add new components to it.

:::danger
nyx is not the best fit for beginners or simple bots. We assume you have some level of understanding of Typescript and
Discord.js.

## 🌠 Introduction

nyx is a framework to build Discord.js bots in Typescript. The main ideas behind nyx are:

* ♻ **Fully replaceable and extendable**. Every working component can be replaced by your own given it fits the required interface.
* 🧱 **Bare-bones**. `@core` has no runtime dependencies, and `@framework` has as little as possible, which you can replace either way.
* 😀 **Easy to understand and setup**. Hacky or unnecessarily messy internal code is avoided, and documentation like this guide or [Typedoc](https://nyx-discord.github.io/nyx/typedoc/) is provided.
* 🌐 **DJS Native**. Nyx tries to reuse or pass DJS objects as much as possible to avoid falling behind on latest features or needing big rewrites when DJS changes.
* 💻 **Developer friendly**. Type safety, predictability, error handling and extensibility are some features that make nyx easy to work with.

Currently, nyx has five main features, each with its own dedicated section. These are:

* [💻 Commands](./features/commands/command-overview.mdx), for Discord application commands.
* [📸 Events](./features/events/event-overview.mdx), for subscribing to events, either from Discord.js or your own.
* [️⏰ Schedules](./features/schedules/schedule-overview.mdx), for timed tasks.
* [👤 Sessions](./features/sessions/session-overview.mdx), for user interaction sessions.
* [️🧩 Plugins](./features/plugins/plugin-overview), for plugins that extend nyx.

## 📋 Packages

The framework is built with two packages: `@nyx-discord/core` and `@nyx-discord/framework`, abbreviated in the guide as `@core` and `@framework`.

### 💠 Core

* Defines all the object templates (interfaces) and their relations for nyx, acting as the blueprint.
* No runtime dependencies (since it doesn't have any actual code), only type dependencies which are `discord.js` and `@discordjs/collection`.
* It doesn't have any actual implementations, so it's not really usable by itself.

### 🧱 Framework

* Provides default, minimal implementations for `@core`, making it directly usable.
* Its implementations are designed to depend on interfaces from `@core`, rather than each other, making those dependencies fully replaceable by your own.
* Minimal runtime dependencies due to its "bare bones" ideology.

### ❓ Which package to install

* Most of the time, you'll want to use `@framework`. Even if you want to include your own components, this library makes it easy to replace them via constructor injection.

* If you want to develop something for nyx, such as a plugin, you can depend only on `@core`. This way, you can depend on the interfaces and not any actual implementations, ensuring that your component will work across all nyx implementations.

:::danger
These docs as a whole heavily assumes that you're using `@framework`'s implementations. The terms "by
default", "the base implementation", etc., all refer to these, as `@core` doesn't have any.
