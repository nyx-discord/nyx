# üóÇÔ∏è SubCommand Group

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

Subcommand groups are non-executable commands inside [Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Parent Commands](./parent-command), whose only purpose is to
store [`Ô∏èüß© SubCommands`](./subcommand).

:::note
While SubCommand Groups don't depend on a specific bot, they do depend on their `ParentCommand`.
:::

## üë∑ Creation

1. Create a sub command group class by either:

* Extending `AbstractSubCommandGroup` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `SubCommandGroup` interface from `@core`.

2. Implement `createData()` that returns the DJS `SlashCommandSubcommandGroupBuilder` that stores the group's data.

:::danger
**Do not** add your children as options inside the `SlashCommandBuilder`. The serialization will do that for you, and
will actually throw an `AssertionError` if you do that.
:::

2. Add subcommand children by either:

* Specifying them in the `children` property.
* Adding them after instantiation with `SubCommandGroup#addChildren()`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending AbstractSubCommandGroup">
```

```ts
class MySubCommandGroup extends AbstractSubCommandGroup {
  protected createData(): SlashCommandSubcommandGroupBuilder {
    return new SlashCommandSubcommandGroupBuilder()
      .setName('hello')
      .setDescription('Hello world!');
  }

  protected children = [
    new MySubCommand(this),
  ]
}

// highlight-next-line
// The parentCommand variable is the ParentCommand that will contain this group
// highlight-next-line
const subCommandGroup = new MySubCommandGroup(parentCommand);

// warn-start
// Throws IllegalDuplicateError if a child with that name already exists
// Throws RangeError if no more children can be added to this command (25)
// Throws AssertionError if this child's parent is not subCommandParent
parentCommand.addChildren(subCommandGroup);
// warn-end
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing SubCommandGroup">
```

```ts
class MySubCommandGroup implements SubCommandGroup {
  // ...
}

// highlight-next-line
// The parentCommand variable is the ParentCommand that will contain this group

const subCommandGroup = new MySubCommandGroup(parentCommand);

// warn-start
// Throws IllegalDuplicateError if a child with that name already exists
// Throws RangeError if no more children can be added to this command (25)
// Throws AssertionError if this child's parent is not subCommandParent
// warn-end
parentCommand.addChildren(subCommandGroup);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## üîÄ Manipulating children

Normally, a parent's children are created alongside the parent, but they can also be added (and removed) on runtime with
`SubCommandGroup#addChildren()`, `SubCommandGroup#removeChildByInstance()` and `SubCommandGroup#removeChildByName()`.

After updating a subcommand group, you must call `CommandManager#update()` on its parent in order to reflect the changes
on Discord.

```ts
const subCommandGroup = new MySubCommandGroup(parentCommand);
parentCommand.addChildren(subCommandGroup);

// highlight-next-line
// Adding a subcommand

const mySubcommand = new MySubCommand(subCommandGroup);

// warn-start
// Throws IllegalDuplicateError if a subcommand with that name already exists
// Throws RangeError if no more children can be added to this group (25)
// Throws AssertionError if this subcommand's parent is not subCommandGroup
// warn-end
subCommandGroup.addChildren(mySubcommand);

await this.bot.getCommandManager().updateCommand(parentCommand);

// highlight-next-line
// Removing a subcommand

// warn-next-line
// Throws ObjectNotFoundError if the subcommand is not present
// warn-next-line
subCommandGroup.removeChildByInstance(mySubcommand);

await this.bot.getCommandManager().updateCommand(parentCommand);
```
