# 🚀 First Start

Hello there! 👋 This step-by-step guide is here to help you make and run a simple nyx bot.

## ⏬ Installation

First, let's start by installing nyx:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @nyx-discord/framework @nyx-discord/core
```

## 👷 Bot Creation

The first step is to create a Discord.js client. This can be any client (as long as it's not logged in or destroyed).

```ts
import {
  Client,
  GatewayIntentBits
} from 'discord.js';

const client = new Client({
  intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds],
});
```

Next up, we'll create a new instance of `Bot`, which is `@framework`'s implementation of `NyxBot`.

You can do that with `Bot#create()`, which takes a function that gets passed the currently constructing bot
instance, and should return the options that you want for the bot.

This is where you'll provide your bot's token, client instance, ID, logger, and other optional settings, like managers.

```ts
import { Bot } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  token: 'TOKEN',
  client,
  id: Symbol('My bot'),
  logger: console, // Can be your own logger

  // For example, if you had a custom command manager:
  // commands: new MyCustomCommandManager(bot),
}));
```

```mdx-code-block
<details>
  <summary>About <code>new Bot()</code></summary>
```
You can also instantiate <code>Bot</code> with the <code>new</code> operator, but in order to allow dependency
injection, this constructor requires every manager on its options, including default ones.

You would need to instantiate and pass every manager to it, like so:

```ts
const myBot = new Bot((bot) => ({
  token: 'TOKEN',
  client,
  id: Symbol('My bot'),
  logger: console,
  events: DefaultEventManager.create(bot, client),
  plugins: DefaultPluginManager.create(bot),
  // and so on
}));
```

You will find this pattern in a lot of other `@framework` objects, where you can instantiate either with
`new SomeComponent(depA, depB, ...)` specifying every default dependency, or with `SomeComponent.create()`
"without" default dependencies.

```mdx-code-block
</details>
```

:::tip
When creating a bot (either via `new` or `#create()`), the type of parameters that you return are used in the bot's
type signature.

This implies that, for example, if you create a `MyCustomCommandManager` and pass it to the bot's options, the bot will
know that its command manager is `MyCustomCommandManager` and not just the generic `CommandManager`, allowing you to use
custom properties or methods that you may have added or modified.
:::

You can create multiple bots and they'll all work independently of each other. This
means you can have many bots for different purposes, in the same server.

## 🚀 Bot Starting

:::tip
You can read more information about bot status in its guide.
:::

To start a bot, you can set it up and then login, or just directly start it:

```ts
await bot.start(); // setups and logins

// or:
await bot.setup();
await bot.login();
```

:::danger
Trying to log in a bot without first setting it up will throw an `IllegalStateError`.
:::

As a quick explanation:

* When a bot is first created, it starts in the `Unsetup` status. It's NOT recommended to interact with the bot on this state.
* Upon calling `Bot#setup()`, all the managers and plugins are notified about the setup. This is done to safely perform
possible asynchronous logic that these objects need to actually function, outside the "object construction" step. The
bot then switches to `Waiting`.
* It's now safe to log in the bot on Discord with `Bot#login()`. Managers and plugins are also notified after the login,
but at this point they should already be ready for it.

## 📚 Summary

The final code would look as follows:

```ts
import { Bot } from '@nyx-discord/framework';
import {
  Client,
  GatewayIntentBits
} from 'discord.js';

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

const bot = Bot.create(() => ({
  token: 'TOKEN',
  client,
  id: Symbol('Bot'),
  logger: console,
}));

await bot.start();
```

And that's it! You now have a running Discord bot with nyx.
