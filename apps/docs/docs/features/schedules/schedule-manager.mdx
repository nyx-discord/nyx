title: ️💼 Schedule Manager
---

The `ScheduleManager` is the object that holds together the nyx schedule system.

It consists of:

* `ScheduleExecutionScheduler` for tracking the execution of schedules.
* `ScheduleRepository` for storing schedules.
* `ScheduleExecutor` for executing schedules.
* `EventBus` for emitting schedule related events.

As well as methods to interact with them.

## 👷 Creation

You can create a custom schedule manager by either:

* Extending `DefaultScheduleManager` from `@nyx-discord/framework` (recommended).
* Implementing `ScheduleManager` from `@nyx-discord/core`.

Then you can pass it to your bot:

```ts
class MyScheduleManager extends DefaultScheduleManager {
  // highlight-next-line
  public myCustomPublicMethod() {}
}

const myBot = Bot.create((bot: NyxBot) => ({
  // ...

  // highlight-next-line
  schedules: new MyScheduleManager(/** ... */),
}));

// highlight-next-line
myBot.getScheduleManager().myCustomPublicMethod() // works!
```

The `Bot` class is able to infer the type of your custom manager via generics, so accessing any custom public method or
property will work without errors.
