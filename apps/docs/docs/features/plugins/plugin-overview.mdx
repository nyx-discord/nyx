Hey there 👋!  This guide is here to document what nyx plugins are, and how you can use them.

## 🧩 Plugins

Plugins are objects that can be used to pack nyx's functionality, such as commands, events, schedules and sessions.

You can create a plugin by implementing the `NyxPlugin` interface.

```ts
import { NyxPlugin } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MyPlugin implements NyxPlugin {
 // ...
}

const myPlugin = new MyPlugin();

await bot.plugins.register(myPlugin);
```
