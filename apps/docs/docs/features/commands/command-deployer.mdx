# 🪐 Command Deployer

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

The `CommandDeployer` is the object responsible for deploying commands. It's stored by a `CommandManager`, and you can get
it via `CommandManager#getDeployer()`.

You can't modify the repository directly since the `CommandManager` returns a `ReadonlyCommandDeployer` type, but the
hidden methods are available at the `CommandManager`. This is because adding, removing and updating a command needs more
logic than just modifying the repository, and the manager is responsible for coordinating this.

## 👷 Creation

You can create a command deployer by either:

* Extending `DefaultCommandDeployer` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `CommandDeployer` interface from `@core`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending DefaultCommandDeployer">
```

```ts
class MyCommandDeployer extends DefaultCommandDeployer {
  // ...
}

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { deployer: myDeployer }),
}))
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing CommandDeployer">
```

```ts
class MyCommandDeployer implements CommandDeployer {
  // ...
}

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { deployer: myDeployer }),
}))
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
