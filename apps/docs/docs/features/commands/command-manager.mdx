title: ️💼 Command Manager
---

The `CommandManager` is the object that holds together the nyx event system.

It consists of:

* `CommandCustomIdCodec`: De/serializes commands names to/from customId strings, useful for creating message components that will trigger commands.
* `CommandResolver`: Resolves the command data that a given command interaction refers to.
* `CommandExecutor`: Executes command objects, checking its `CommandMiddlewareList` and passing any errors to its `ErrorHandler`.
* `CommandRepository`: Stores all the currently registered commands and their command application mappings. It's also responsible for registering commands at Discord.
* `CommandSubscriptionsContainer`: Stores the [📩 Event Subscribers](../events/event-subscriber) that are subscribed to the [👂 Client event bus](../events/event-manager.mdx#-client-event-bus) to listen for command interactions.
* `EventBus`: An [📣 Event Bus](../events/event-bus) that emits command related events.

As well as methods to interact with them.

## 👷 Creation

You can create a custom command manager by either:

* Extending `DefaultCommandManager` from `@nyx-discord/framework` (recommended).
* Implementing `CommandManager` from `@nyx-discord/core`.

Then you can pass it to your bot:

```ts
class MyCommandManager extends DefaultCommandManager {
  // highlight-next-line
  public myCustomPublicMethod() {}
}

const myBot = Bot.create((bot: NyxBot) => ({
  // ...

  // highlight-next-line
  events: new MyCommandManager(/** ... */),
}));

// highlight-next-line
myBot.getCommandManager().myCustomPublicMethod() // works!
```

The `Bot` class is able to infer the type of your custom manager via generics, so accessing any custom public method or
property will work without errors.
