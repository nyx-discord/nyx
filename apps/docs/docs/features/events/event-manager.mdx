title: ðŸ’¼ Event Manager
---

The `EventManager` is the object that holds together the nyx event system.

It consists of:

* The `EventBus` collection for storing buses, mapped by their IDs.
* An `EventBus` for Bot events.
* An `EventBus` for Client events.
* An `EventBus` for Manager events.

As well as methods to interact with them.

## ðŸ‘· Creation

You can create a custom event manager by either:

* Extending `DefaultEventManager` from `@nyx-discord/framework` (recommended).
* Implementing `EventManager` from `@nyx-discord/core`.

Then you can pass it to your bot:

```ts
class MyEventManager extends DefaultEventManager {
  // highlight-next-line
  public myCustomPublicMethod() {}
}

const myBot = Bot.create((bot: NyxBot) => ({
  // ...

  // highlight-next-line
  events: new MyEventManager(/** ... */),
}));

// highlight-next-line
myBot.getEventManager().myCustomPublicMethod() // Works!
```

The `Bot` class is able to infer the type of your custom manager via generics, so accessing any custom public method or
property will work without errors.

## ðŸ‘‚ Client event bus

The manager holds a `EventBus` that wraps the Discord.js `Client`, for client events. You can get it with
`EventManager#getClientBus()`, and you can directly subscribe to it with `EventManager#subscribeClient()`.

You can use the utility abstraction on `@nyx-discord/framework` for a subscriber for a Client,
the `AbstractDJSClientSubscriber`. It receives a generic which is the handled event, where you can use the
discord.js `Event` enum. Said value will be used to safely type the arguments of the event handler.

```ts
import { Events } from 'discord.js';
import { AbstractDJSClientSubscriber } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class InteractionCreateSubscriber
  extends AbstractDJSClientSubscriber<Events.InteractionCreate> {
  protected override readonly event = Events.InteractionCreate;

  public handleEvent(
    meta: EventDispatchMeta,
    interaction: Interaction,
  ): void {
    // Since the built-in client event bus has a bot, this will never throw an error.
    const bot = meta.getBot(true);

    bot.getLogger().info(`Interaction ${interaction.id} received.`);
  }
}

const subscriber = new InteractionCreateSubscriber();
await bot.getEventManager().subscribeClient(subscriber);

// same as:
const bus = bot.getEventManager().getClientBus();
await bus.subscribe(subscriber);
```
