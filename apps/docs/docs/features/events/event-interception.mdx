#  Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏è Event Interception

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

Event interception refers to blocking a subscriber from receiving an event. In nyx, there are two ways to do this:

1. Add an `EventSubscriberMiddleware` to the `SubscriberMiddlewareList` in the `EventDispatcher` that handles
the event execution.
2. Provide an `EventSubscriberFilter` in the `EventSubscriber` that receives the event.

Let's explore when and how to use each of these methods.

## üö¶ Subscriber Middlewares

`EventSubscriberMiddlewares` are objects stored on a `SubscriberMiddlewareList`, which is held and called by
the event dispatcher every time an event is about to be notified to a subscriber.

It consists of:
* A `check()` method, which takes a subscriber and its arguments. Returns a `MiddlewareResponse`.
* A `Priority`, that determines its priority inside the list.

When being checked, a middleware is passed the subscriber that is being checked and the arguments that would be
used to call it. The middleware then replies with a `MiddlewareResponse`, which can either:

* Make the list check the next middleware: `{ allowed: true, checkNext: true }`.
* Forcing the execution to end as with an allowed result: `{ allowed: true, checkNext: false }`.
* Deny the execution: `{ allowed: false, checkNext: false }`.

The `AbstractMiddleware`, has `protected` utility methods to generate these responses. Specifically, `this.true()`,
`this.false()` and `this.forceTrue()`.

:::info
Middlewares are not bot aware nor event bus aware, meaning that you can reuse the same instance for many event buses.

From the `EventDispatchMeta` passed on the subscriber's args you can get:

* The bot that called the event, via `#getBot()`.
* The bus where the event was emitted, via `#getBus()`.
* Whether the event has been marked as handled by another subscriber, via `#isHandled()`.

:::

### ‚ùì When to use a middleware?

Middlewares are best for executing something or intercepting for all subscribers. For example,
filtering (`EventSubscriberFilter`) and handling marking (`EventDispatchMeta#setHandled()`) logic are done by
middlewares.

They're very good when intercepting `EventSubscribers` in general, but not really for one in particular, since it would
be very inefficient to check all the subscribers searching for only one of them.

### üë∑‚Äç Middleware Creation

You can create your own middleware by either:

* Extending `AbstractEventSubscriberMiddleware` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `EventSubscriberMiddleware` interface from `@core`.


```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending AbstractEventSubscriberMiddleware">
```

```ts
import type {
  EventSubscriber,
  EventDispatchArgs,
  MiddlewareResponse
} from '@nyx-discord/core';
import { AbstractEventSubscriberMiddleware } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MyFrameworkEventSubscriberMiddleware extends AbstractEventSubscriberMiddleware {
  public check(subscriber: EventSubscriber, args: EventDispatchArgs): MiddlewareResponse {
    return this.true();
  }
}

const frameworkMiddleware = new MyFrameworkEventSubscriberMiddleware();

myBus.getDispatcher().getMiddleware().add(frameworkMiddleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing EventSubscriberMiddleware">
```

```ts
import { EventSubscriberMiddleware } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MyInterfaceEventSubscriber implements EventSubscriberMiddleware {
  // ...
}

const interfaceMiddleware = new MyInterfaceEventSubscriber();

myBus.getDispatcher().getMiddleware().add(interfaceMiddleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

By default, the following middleware list is used:

* `HandleCheckEventMiddleware` - See [‚úÖ Event handling marking](event-subscriber#-event-handling-marking) on the
`EventSubscriber` guide.
* `SubscriberFilterCheckMiddleware` - See [üöß Subscriber Filters](#-subscriber-filters).
* `LifetimeEventBusMiddleware` - See [üíü Lifetime](event-subscriber#-lifetime) on the `EventSubscriber` guide.

## üöß Subscriber Filters

An `EventSubscriberFilter` is a nullable object provided by an `EventSubscriber`, checked by
the `SubscriberFilterCheckMiddleware`.

:::info
Filters are not bot aware nor event subscriber aware, meaning that you can reuse the same instance for many subscribers.

From the `EventDispatchMeta` passed on the subscriber's args you can get:

* The bot that called the event, via `#getBot()`.
* The bus where the event was emitted, via `#getBus()`.
* Whether the event has been marked as handled by another subscriber, via `#isHandled()`.

:::

:::tip
Think of a filter like adding an `if` at the beginning of your subscriber's `#handleEvent()`, except it
gets checked before the subscriber is executed and, since it's an object, you can reuse it for multiple subscribers and
save state on it.
:::

Though subscribers can only provide one filter, `@framework` provides utility filter aggregators that implement the
basic `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates, that can help you "combine" multiple filters into one.

### ‚ùì When to use a filter?

Filters are best suited for sharing common conditions that multiple subscribers should share before executing.

Also, since they have access to the subscriber that is being filtered and the `EventCallMeta` object, filters can share
information to the subscriber, effectively working as a "pre-processor".

You can create your own filter by either:

* Extending `AbstractEventSubscriberFilter` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `EventSubscriberFilter` interface from `@core`.
