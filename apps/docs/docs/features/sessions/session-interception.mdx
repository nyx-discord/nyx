Session interception refers to blocking a session from being executed. In nyx, there are two ways to do this:

1. Add a `SessionMiddleware` to the respective `SessionMiddlewareList` in the `SessionExecutor` that handles
the session execution.
2. Provide the respective `SessionFilter` in the `Session`.

Let's explore when and how to use each of these methods.

## üö¶ Session Middlewares

`SessionMiddlewares` are objects stored on a `SessionMiddlewareList`, which is held and called by
the session executor when a session is about to be executed.

Specifically, there are two types of session middlewares:
* `SessionStartMiddleware` - Checked when a session starts.
* `SessionUpdateMiddleware` - Checked when a session is updated.

Each consist of:
* A `check()` method, which takes a session and its arguments. Returns a `MiddlewareResponse`.
* A `Priority`, that determines its priority inside the list.

When being checked, a middleware is passed the session that is being checked and the execution metadata. The session then
replies with a `MiddlewareResponse`, which can either:

* Make the list check the next middleware: `{ allowed: true, checkNext: true }`.
* Forcing the execution to end as with an allowed result: `{ allowed: true, checkNext: false }`.
* Deny the execution: `{ allowed: false, checkNext: false }`.

The `AbstractMiddleware`, has `protected` utility methods to generate these responses. Specifically, `this.true()`,
`this.false()` and `this.forceTrue()`.

### ‚ùì When to use a middleware?

Middlewares are best for executing something or intercepting for all sessions. For example, the filtering
(`SessionFilter`) logic is done by a middleware.

They're very good when intercepting `Sessions` in general, but not really for one in particular, since it
would be very inefficient to check all the sessions searching for only one of them.

### üë∑‚Äç Middleware Creation

You can create your own middleware by either:

* Extending the respective `AbstractSessionMiddleware` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the respective `SessionMiddleware` interface from `@core`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending an AbstractSessionMiddleware">
```

```ts
import {
  AbstractSessionStartMiddleware,
  AbstractSessionUpdateMiddleware,
} from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MySessionStartMiddleware extends AbstractSessionStartMiddleware {
  public check(session: Session, ...args: SessionStartArgs): MiddlewareResponse {
    return this.true();
  }
}

const startMiddleware = new MySessionStartMiddleware();
bot.getSessionManager().getExecutor().getStartMiddleware().add(startMiddleware);

class MySessionUpdateMiddleware extends AbstractSessionUpdateMiddleware {
  public check(session: Session, ...args: SessionUpdateArgs): MiddlewareResponse {
    return this.true();
  }
}

const updateMiddleware = new MySessionUpdateMiddleware();
bot.getSessionManager().getExecutor().getUpdateMiddleware().add(updateMiddleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing SessionMiddleware">
```

```ts
import { SessionStartMiddleware, SessionUpdateMiddleware } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MySessionStartMiddleware implements SessionStartMiddleware {
  // ...
}

const startMiddleware = new MySessionStartMiddleware();
bot.getSessionManager().getExecutor().getStartMiddleware().add(startMiddleware);

class MySessionUpdateMiddleware implements SessionUpdateMiddleware {
  // ...
}

const updateMiddleware = new MySessionUpdateMiddleware();
bot.getSessionManager().getExecutor().getUpdateMiddleware().add(updateMiddleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

By default, the following middleware list is used:

* `SessionFilterCheckMiddleware` - See [üöß Session Filters](#-Session-filters).

## üöß Session Filters

An `SessionFilter` is a nullable object provided by an `Session`, checked by a `SessionFilterCheckMiddleware`.

Specifically, there are two types of session filters:
* `SessionStartFilter` - Checked when the session starts.
* `SessionUpdateFilter` - Checked when the session is updated.

:::info
Filters are not bot aware nor session aware, meaning that you can reuse the same instance for many sessions.

:::tip
Think of a filter like adding an `if` at the beginning of your session's execution, except it gets checked before the
session is executed and, since it's an object, you can reuse it for multiple sessions or save state on it.
:::

Though sessions can only provide one filter, `@framework` provides utility filter aggregators that implement the
basic `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates, that can help you "combine" multiple filters into one.

### ‚ùì When to use a filter?

Filters are best suited for sharing common conditions that multiple sessions should share before executing.

Also, since they have access to the session that is being filtered and the `SessionExecutionMeta` object, filters can
share information to the session, effectively working as a "pre-processor".

* Extending the respective `AbstractSessionFilter` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the respective `SessionFilter` interface from `@core`.
