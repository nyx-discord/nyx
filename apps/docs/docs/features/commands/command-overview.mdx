Hey there ðŸ‘‹!  This guide is here to give you a fast understanding of how nyx's command system works, so you can use it
right away. For in-depth details, see the respective guides of each command related object.

## ðŸ“š Description

The command system in nyx is made up of several objects that work together to receive commands from users and routing
said execution to the correspondent command object, all coordinated by a `CommandManager`.

Specifically, the command related objects are:

* `CommandManager`: The entry point for the command system, holding all the command-related objects and methods that use all of these objects. All objects below are contained here.
* `CommandCustomIdCodec`: De/serializes commands names to/from customId strings, useful for creating message components that will trigger commands.
* `CommandResolver`: Resolves the command data that a given command interaction refers to.
* `CommandExecutor`: Executes command objects, checking its `CommandMiddlewareList` and passing any errors to its `ErrorHandler`.
* `CommandRepository`: Stores all the currently registered commands and their command application mappings. It's also responsible for registering commands at Discord.
* `CommandSubscriptionsContainer`: Stores the [ðŸ“© Event Subscribers](../events/event-subscriber) that are subscribed to the [ðŸ‘‚ Client event bus](../events/event-manager.mdx#-client-event-bus) to listen for command interactions.
* `EventBus`: An [ðŸ“£ Event Bus](../events/event-bus) that emits command related events.

As well as the actual commands:

* `StandaloneCommand`: A fully executable, top level command with no children. Can be executed via a slash command, or
context menus (User or Message).
* `ParentCommand`: A non-executable command that only serves to store subcommands or subcommand groups.
* `SubCommand`: An executable command inside a `ParentCommand`. Can only be executed via a slash command.
* `SubCommandGroup`: An non-executable command inside a `ParentCommand` that only serves to store subcommands.

:::tip
Commands don't depend on a specific bot, and you can reuse the same instance for many.

From the `CommandExecutionMeta` passed on the command's execution (alongside the interaction) you can get:

* The bot that received the command interaction, via `#getBot()`.
* The timestamp when the command execution began, via `#getCreatedAt()`.
* Other properties a filter or middleware may have set, via `#get()`.

  <summary>Command handling process overview</summary>

  Here's a high-level overview of how the system works, using a `ChatInputCommandInteraction` as an example:

  1. A user triggers a command in Discord.
  2. The `'interactionCreate'` event is emitted by
  the [Discord.js Client](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/class/Client), passing the interaction as an
  argument.
  3. The `ClientEventBus` receives it and starts notifying its subscribers.
  4. One of these subscribers is the `CommandInteractionSubscriber`, stored on
  the `CommandSubscriptionsContainer`.
  5. The subscriber passes the interaction to the `CommandManager`.
  6. The manager uses the `CommandResolver` to extract to what command the interaction refers to.
  7. The command reference data is passed to the `CommandRepository`, to search for a command that matches that data.
  8. If a command is found, the manager passes the execution to the `CommandExecutor`.
  9. The executor checks what method it should execute according to the interaction. In this
  case, `ExecutableCommand#execute()`.
  10. Once it knows what it should execute, it checks its `CommandMiddlewareList` which determines whether to
  allow
  or deny the command's execution. If it's allowed, the command is called.
  11. If any errors occur, they are passed to its [`ErrorHandler`](../../error/error-handling).
  12. The `CommandManager` uses the `EventBus` to emit a `CommandRun` event asynchronously, passing the executed command
  and its arguments.

## âœ¨ Quick examples

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Creating a Ping Command">
```

1. Extend `AbstractStandaloneCommand`, implementing `execute()` and `data`.
2. Register it to a bot's `CommandManager`.

```ts
class PingCommand extends AbstractStandaloneCommand {
  protected data: StandaloneCommandData = {
    name: 'ping',
    description: 'Pong!',
  };

  public async execute(interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    await interaction.reply('Pong!');
  }
}

const command = new PingCommand();
await bot.commands.addCommand(command);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Creating a SubCommand">
```

1. Extend `AbstractParentCommand`, implementing `children` and `data`. This will be the command containing the subcommand.
2. Extend `AbstractSubCommand`, implementing `execute()` and `data`.
3. Register the parent command to a bot's `CommandManager`.

```ts
class UserParentCommand extends AbstractParentCommand {
  protected data: ParentCommandData = {
    name: 'user',
    description: 'User-related commands',
  };

  protected children: AbstractSubCommand[] = [
    new UserNameCommand(),
  ]
}

class UserNameCommand extends AbstractSubCommand {
  protected data: SubCommandData = {
    name: 'name',
    description: 'Returns your name.',
  };

  public async execute(interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    await interaction.reply(interaction.user.username);
  }
}

const parent = new UserParentCommand();
await bot.commands.addCommand(parent);
```


```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Autocompleting options">
```

From your executable command (a `StandaloneCommand` or `SubCommand`) implement `autocomplete()`. This needs to
return an array of autocomplete options, either directly or on a promise (async method).

```ts
class AutocompletableCommand extends AbstractStandaloneCommand {
  public autocomplete(
    option: AutocompleteFocusedOption,
    interaction: AutocompleteInteraction,
  ) {
    return [
      { name: 'foo', value: 'bar' },
    ];
  }
}
```

:::tip
The `CommandExecutor` can perform extra filtering logic to your autocomplete options before actually responding. If you
want to override this and directly answer with any given options, use the 4th parameter of `ExecutableCommand#autocomplete()`.
This is a callback that receives your options as a parameter.

It's advised that you use this callback instead of `AutocompleteInteraction#respond()`, since the callback will perform
error routing logic if the method throws an error.
