Hey there 👋!  This guide is here to give you a fast understanding of how nyx's command system works, so you can use it
right away. For in-depth details, see the respective guides of each command related object.

## 📚 Description

The command system in nyx is made up of several objects that work together to receive commands from users and routing
said execution to the correspondent command object, all coordinated by a `CommandManager`.

Specifically, the command related objects are:

* [`💼 CommandManager`](./command-manager.mdx): The entry point for the command system, holding all the command-related objects and methods that use all of these objects. All objects below are contained here.
* [`💬 CommandCustomIdCodec`](./command-customid-codec.mdx): De/serializes commands names to/from customId strings, useful for creating message components that will trigger commands.
* [`🔀 CommandResolver`](./command-resolver.mdx): Resolves the command that a given command interaction refers to.
* [`⚡ CommandExecutor`](./command-executor.mdx): Executes commands, checking its `CommandMiddlewareList` and passing errors to the [`💫 ErrorHandler`](../../error/error-handling).
* [`📔 CommandRepository`](./command-repository.mdx): Stores all the currently registered commands.
* [`🪐 CommandDeployer`](./command-deployer.mdx): Deploys commands to Discord and stores the ApplicationCommand mappings.
* [`👂 CommandSubscriptionsContainer`](./command-subscribers.mdx): Stores the [📩 Event Subscribers](../events/event-subscriber) that are subscribed to the [👂 Client event bus](../events/event-manager.mdx#-client-event-bus) to listen for command interactions.
* [`📣 EventBus`](./command-bus.mdx): An [📣 Event Bus](../events/event-bus) that emits command related events.

As well as the actual commands:

* [`🚀 Standalone Command`](./commands/standalone-command.mdx): A slash command with no children.
* `🧾 Context Menu Command`: A context menu command (either User or Message).
* [`️👨‍👧‍👦 Parent Command`](./commands/parent-command.mdx): A non-executable command that only serves to store subcommands or subcommand groups.
* [`🧩 SubCommand`](./commands/subcommand.mdx): An executable command inside a `ParentCommand`. Can only be executed via a slash command.
* [`🗂️ SubCommand Group`](./commands/subcommand-group.mdx): An non-executable command inside a `ParentCommand` that only serves to store subcommands.

## 🔢 Slash command execution sequence

:::tip
- A dashed step means it's executed asynchronously, so the next one is inmediately executed.
- You can hover over steps with `(?)` to see extra details.

## 📚 Creating a command

The overall process of creating a command is to instantiate and register it to a `CommandManager`.

If the bot has started, it will immediately be deployed to Discord, and its `ApplicationCommand` mapping will be
available on the `CommandDeployer`. If the bot hasn't started, it will be queued to be deployed once it starts if
`deployCommands` is true.

Aditionally, commands don't depend on a specific bot, and you can reuse the same instance for many.

:::warning
By default, commands are registered using `ApplicationCommandManager#set()`. This means that commands deployed to
Discord that are no longer registered will be deleted from there.
:::

:::tip
Make sure to register all your commands before starting the bot to minimize the amount of API calls, since registering
them after the bot has started will cause another API call.

## ✨ Quick examples

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Creating a Ping Command">
```

1. Extend `AbstractStandaloneCommand`, implementing `execute()` and `createData()`.
2. Register it to a bot's `CommandManager`.

```ts
class PingCommand extends AbstractStandaloneCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new SlashCommandBuilder()
      .setName('ping')
      .setDescription('Pong!');
  }

  public async execute(interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    await interaction.reply('Pong!');
  }
}

const command = new PingCommand();
await bot.getCommandManager().addCommands(command);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Creating a ContextMenuCommand">
```

1. Extend `AbstractContextMenuCommand`, implementing `createData()`.
2. Implement `executeUser()` if you're making a User Context Menu, or `executeMessage()` if you're making a Message Context Menu.
3. Register it to a bot's `CommandManager`.

* User Context Menu:

```ts
class NameContextMenuCommand extends AbstractContextMenuCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new ContextMenuCommandBuilder()
      .setName('name')
      .setType(ApplicationCommandType.User);
  }

  public async executeUser(interaction: UserContextMenuCommandInteraction) {
    const user = interaction.targetUser;
    await interaction.reply(`This is ${user.username}`);
  }
}

const command = new NameContextMenuCommand();
await bot.getCommandManager().addCommands(command);
```

* Message Context Menu:

```ts
class MessageContentContextMenuCommand extends AbstractContextMenuCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new ContextMenuCommandBuilder()
      .setName('content')
      .setType(ApplicationCommandType.Message);
  }

  public async executeMessage(interaction: MessageContextMenuCommandInteraction) {
    const message = interaction.targetMessage;
    await interaction.reply(`This message's content is ${message.content}`);
  }
}

const command = new MessageContentContextMenuCommand();
await bot.getCommandManager().addCommands(command);
```

:::danger
There won't be any type errors if you don't implement the correspondent execute method for your command (like if you
don't implement `executeUser()` with `ApplicationCommandType.User`), but you'll get a `NotImplementedError` once the
command is actually executed, which will be handled by the [`ErrorHandler`](../../error/error-handling).
:::

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Creating a SubCommand">
```

1. Extend `AbstractParentCommand`, implementing `children` and `createData()`. This will be the command containing the subcommand.
2. Extend `AbstractSubCommand`, implementing `execute()` and `createData()`.
3. Register the parent command to a bot's `CommandManager`.

:::danger
**Do not** add the subcommand as an option inside the `SlashCommandBuilder`. The serialization will do that for you, and
will actually throw an `AssertionError` if you do that.
:::

```ts
class UserParentCommand extends AbstractParentCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new SlashCommandBuilder()
      .setName('user')
      .setDescription('User-related commands');
  }

  // highlight-start
  protected children = [
    new NameSubCommand(this),
  ]
  // highlight-end
}

class NameSubCommand extends AbstractSubCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new SlashCommandSubcommandBuilder()
      .setName('name')
      .setDescription('Returns your name.');
  }

  public async execute(interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    await interaction.reply(interaction.user.username);
  }
}

const parent = new UserParentCommand();
await bot.getCommandManager().addCommands(parent);
```

:::tip
Instead of implementing `children`, you could also add the subcommand with `#addChildren()`:
```ts
// Same classes as above but parent doesn't implement children:

const parent = new UserParentCommand();

const subCommand = new NameSubCommand(group);
group.addChildren(subCommand);

await bot.getCommandManager().addCommands(parent);
```
:::

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Creating a SubCommandGroup">
```

1. Extend `AbstractParentCommand`, implementing `children` and `createData()`. This will be the command containing the subcommand group.
2. Extend `AbstractSubCommandGroup`, implementing `createData()`.
3. Extend `AbstractSubCommand`, implementing `execute()` and `createData()`.
4. Register the parent command to a bot's `CommandManager`.

:::danger
**Do not** add the subcommand group as an option inside the `SlashCommandBuilder` or the subcommand inside the
`SlashCommandSubcommandGroupBuilder`. The serialization will do that for you, and will actually throw an `AssertionError`
if you do that.
:::

```ts
// Create the ParentCommand
class PhotoParentCommand extends AbstractParentCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new SlashCommandBuilder()
      .setName('photo')
      .setDescription('See photos of various things');
  }

  // highlight-start
  protected children = [
    new AnimalPhotoSubCommandGroup(this),
  ]
// highlight-end
}

// Create the SubCommandGroup
class AnimalPhotoSubCommandGroup extends AbstractSubCommandGroup {
  protected createData() {
    return new SlashCommandSubcommandGroupBuilder()
      .setName('animal')
      .setDescription('See animal-related photos');
  }

  // highlight-start
  protected children = [
    new DogSubCommand(this),
  ]
  // highlight-end
}

// Create the SubCommand
class DogSubCommand extends AbstractSubCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new SlashCommandSubcommandBuilder()
      .setName('dog')
      .setDescription('See a random photo of a dog.');
  }

  public async execute(interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    const photo = await getRandomDogPhoto();
    await interaction.reply(photo);
  }
}

const parent = new PhotoParentCommand();
await bot.getCommandManager().addCommands(parent);
```

:::tip
Instead of implementing `children`, you could also add the group (and/or the subcommand) with `#addChildren()`:
```ts
// Same classes as above but parent and group don't implement children:

const parent = new PhotoParentCommand();

// You can add the group first and then the subcommand or the way around,
// order doesn't matter.

const group = new AnimalPhotoSubCommandGroup(parent);
parent.addChildren(group);

const subCommand = new DogSubCommand(group);
group.addChildren(subCommand);

await bot.getCommandManager().addCommands(parent);
```
:::

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Autocompletion">
```

From your executable command (a `StandaloneCommand` or `SubCommand`) implement `autocomplete()`.

```ts
class AutocompletableCommand extends AbstractStandaloneCommand {
  public async autocomplete(interaction: AutocompleteInteraction) {
    await interaction.respond([
      { name: 'foo', value: 'bar' },
    ]);
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
