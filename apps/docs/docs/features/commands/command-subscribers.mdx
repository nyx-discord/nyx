title: ðŸ‘‚ Command Subscriptions
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The `CommandSubscriptionsContainer` is the object responsible for managing command subscriptions. That is, the subscribers
that are subscribed to the [Client Event Bus](../events/event-manager#-client-event-bus), and are listening to
`interactionCreate` events. It's stored by a `CommandManager`, and you can get it via
`CommandManager#getSubscriptions()`.

With this object you can override the manager's command subscribers, letting you add your own custom logic in runtime.

Specifically, it stores the `CommandInteractionSubscriber` and `DefaultCommandAutocompleteSubscriber`.
The first listens for command and component interactions, routing them to `CommandManager#execute()` and the second
listens for autocomplete interactions, routing them to `CommandManager#autocomplete()`.

## ðŸ‘· Creation

You can create a command subscriptions container by either:

* Extending `DefaultCommandSubscriptionsContainer` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `CommandSubscriptionsContainer` interface from `@core`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending DefaultCommandSubscriptionsContainer">
```

```ts
class MyCommandSubscriptionsContainer extends DefaultCommandSubscriptionsContainer {
  // ...
}

const myContainer = new MyCommandSubscriptionsContainer();

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { subscriptionsContainer: myContainer }),
}));
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing CommandSubscriptionsContainer">
```

```ts
class MyCommandSubscriptionsContainer implements CommandSubscriptionsContainer {
  // ...
}

const myContainer = new MyCommandSubscriptionsContainer();

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { subscriptionsContainer: myContainer }),
}));
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## ðŸ‘‚ Replacing command subscribers

You can use this object to override the manager's command subscribers, letting you add your own custom logic in runtime.

:::note
For more information about creating subscribers, check the [ðŸ“© Event Subscribers](../events/event-subscriber) guide.
:::

```ts
class MyCommandInteractionSubscriber extends AbstractDJSClientSubscriber<'interactionCreate'> {
  protected override readonly event = Events.InteractionCreate;

  public async handleEvent(
    meta: EventDispatchMeta,
    interaction: Interaction,
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Your custom logic.
  }
}

const subscriber = new MyCommandInteractionSubscriber();
await bot.commands.getSubscriptions().setInteractionSubscriber(subscriber);
```

:::danger
This will completely override the default subscriber. If your custom subscriber doesn't perform the logic that it
should, your bot could ignore commands completely.

You can check the `DefaultCommandInteractionSubscriber` and `DefaultCommandAutocompleteSubscriber` source to see how a
command subscriber should work.
