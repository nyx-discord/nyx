title: üí´ Error Handling
---

In nyx, every executor holds an `ErrorHandler`, where errors thrown by middlewares and executed objects are handled.

An error handler behaves like a map of consumers, where the key is the error constructor (the class) and the value is an
`ErrorConsumer`, which is a callback that receives the error, the object, the arguments that were used to call it
and the bot.

## üî® Manipulating consumers

To add a consumer, use `ErrorHandler#setConsumer()`:

```ts
const errorHandler = bot.commands.getExecutor().getErrorHandler();

errorHandler.setConsumer(
  MyError,
  (
    error: MyError,
    command: ExecutableCommand<CommandData>,
    args: CommandExecutionArgs,
  ) => {
    const [meta] = args;
    const bot = meta.getBot(true);

    const { name } = command.getData();

    logger.error(
      `MyError occurred while executing ${name} with args: ${args}`,
      error
    );
  }
);
```

To remove a consumer, use `ErrorHandler#removeConsumer()`:

```ts
const errorHandler = bot.commands.getExecutor().getErrorHandler();

errorHandler.removeConsumer(MyError);
```

## ‚è¨ Fallback consumer

The `ErrorHandler` has a fallback consumer, which is used if no consumer was found for a given error.

```ts
const errorHandler = bot.commands.getExecutor().getErrorHandler();

errorHandler.setFallbackConsumer(
  (
    error: object,
    command: ExecutableCommand<CommandData>,
    args: CommandExecutionArgs,
  ) => {
    const [meta] = args;
    const bot = meta.getBot(true);
    const { name } = command.getData();

    logger.error(
      `An unhandled error occurred while executing ${name} with args: ${args}`,
      error
    );
  }
);
```

## üîé Consumer resolution

The `BasicErrorHandler` resolves a consumer based on the error prototype, going from the top to the bottom.

:::note
For instance, if `MyError2` extends `MyError1` which extends `MyError`, then it will first try to resolve the consumer
for `MyError2`, then for `MyError1` and finally for `MyError`.
:::

If no consumer is found, the fallback consumer is used, whose error type is simply `object`.
