title: Ô∏è‚åö Schedules
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

`Schedules` are objects that will be ticked some time in the future, and can be used as a feature complete way of
scheduling events in your bot, apart from Node's `setInterval()` API.

It consists of:

* An `Identifier`, to uniquely identify it.
* The `tick()` method, which will be called when it's ticked.
* A `ScheduleInterval`, which can be a string on [cron format](https://crontab.guru/), a number in milliseconds, or a [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).
* An optional [`ScheduleFilter`](./schedule-interception#-schedule-filters), which can allow or deny its tick.
* A `ReadonlyMetaCollection`, which contains meta information about the schedule, meant to be read by plugins.
* `onRegister()` and `onUnregister()` methods, which will be called when the schedule is registered and unregistered respectively.

Schedules aren't ticked by themselves, and rely on a job to do that. You can read more information about jobs on the
[üîç Schedule Execution Scheduler](./schedule-scheduler) documentation.

:::info
Filters are not bot aware, meaning that you can reuse the same instance for many bots.

## üë∑ Creation

You can create a schedule by either:

* Extending `AbstractSchedule` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `Schedule` interface from `@core`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending AbstractSchedule">
```

```ts
import { AbstractSchedule } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MySchedule extends AbstractSchedule {
  // Cron format (every half hour). Can also be a Date or number in ms.
  protected readonly interval = '*/30 * * * *';

  public async tick(meta: ScheduleTickMeta) {
    const bot = meta.getBot();

    bot.logger.log("Hello world!");
  }
}

const schedule = new MySchedule();
await bot.getScheduleManager().addSchedule(schedule);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing Schedule">
```

```ts
class MySchedule implements Schedule {
  // ...
}

const schedule = new MySchedule();
await bot.getScheduleManager().addSchedule(schedule);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
