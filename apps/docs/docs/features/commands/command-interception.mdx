import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

Command interception refers to blocking a command from being executed. In nyx, there are two ways to do this:

1. Add a `CommandMiddleware` to the `CommandMiddlewareList` in the `CommandExecutor` that handles
the command execution.
2. Provide a `CommandFilter` in the `ExecutableCommand`.

Let's explore when and how to use each of these methods.

## üö¶ Command Middlewares

`CommandMiddlewares` are objects stored on a `CommandMiddlewareList`, which is held and called by
the command executor when a command is about to be executed.

It consists of:
* A `check()` method, which takes a command and its arguments. Returns a `MiddlewareResponse`.
* A `Priority`, that determines its priority inside the list.

When being checked, a middleware is passed the command that is being checked and the arguments that would be
used to call it. The middleware then replies with a `MiddlewareResponse`, which can either:

* Allow the execution (`{ allowed: true }`), with either:
* Making the linked list check the next middleware (`{ allowed: true, checkNext: true }`).
* Forcing the chain to end (`{ allowed: true, checkNext: false }`).
* Deny the execution (`{ allowed: false, checkNext: false }`).

The `AbstractMiddleware`, has `protected` utility methods to generate these responses. Specifically, `this.true()`,
`this.false()` and `this.forceTrue()`.

### ‚ùì When to use a middleware?

Middlewares are best for executing something or intercepting for all commands. For example, the filtering
(`CommandFilter`) logic is done by a middleware.

They're very good when intercepting `ExecutableCommands` in general, but not really for one in particular, since it
would be very inefficient to check all the commands searching for only one of them.

### üë∑‚Äç Middleware Creation

You can create your own middleware by either:

* Extending `AbstractCommandMiddleware` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `CommandMiddleware` interface from `@core`.


```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending AbstractCommandMiddleware">
```

```ts
import { AbstractCommandMiddleware } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MyCommandMiddleware extends AbstractCommandMiddleware {
  public check(command: ExecutableCommand<CommandData>, args: CommandExecutionArgs): MiddlewareResponse {
    return this.true();
  }
}

const middleware = new MyCommandMiddleware();

bot.commands.getExecutor().getMiddleware().add(middleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing CommandMiddleware">
```

```ts
import { CommandMiddleware } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MyCommandMiddleware implements CommandMiddleware {
  // ...
}

const middleware = new MyCommandMiddleware();

bot.commands.getExecutor().getMiddleware().add(middleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

By default, the following middleware chain is used:

* `CommandFilterCheckMiddleware` - See [üöß Command Filters](#-command-filters).

## üöß Command Filters

An `CommandFilter` is a nullable object provided by an `ExecutableCommand`, checked by the `CommandFilterCheckMiddleware`.

:::info
Filters are not bot aware nor command aware, meaning that you can reuse the same instance for many commands.
:::

:::tip
Think of a filter like adding an `if` at the beginning of your command's execution, except it gets checked before the
command is executed and, since it's an object, you can reuse it for multiple commands or save state on it.
:::

Though commands can only provide one filter, `@framework` provides utility filter aggregators that implement the
basic `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates, that can help you "combine" multiple filters into one.

### ‚ùì When to use a filter?

Filters are best suited for sharing common conditions that multiple commands should share before executing.

Also, since they have access to the command that is being filtered and the `CommandExecutionMeta` object, filters can
share information to the command, effectively working as a "pre-processor".
