Hey there üëã!  This guide is here to give you a fast understanding of how nyx's schedule system works, so you can use it
right away. For in-depth details, see the respective guides of each schedule related object.

## üìö Description

`Schedules` are objects that are ticked some time in the future, and can be used as a feature complete way of scheduling
events in your bot, apart from Node's `setInterval()` API.

In essence, a `Schedule` object contains its ticking logic and its interval of when it wishes to be executed, which
can be in [cron](https://crontab.guru/) format, in an amount of ms (`number`), or as a `Date`. When a schedule is added
via the `ScheduleManager`, the `ScheduleExecutionScheduler` creates a new `ScheduleJobAdapter` for it, which will start
ticking the schedule using the `ScheduleExecutor`.

:::danger
It's important to note that the `ScheduleExecutionScheduler` is implementation-specific. For example, `@framework`'s
implementation uses the [cron npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron) to create the job.

To add a layer of abstraction, the `ScheduleExecutionScheduler`'s interface doesn't return any specific job type, but
rather a `ScheduleJobAdapter`, which has methods like resume, pause, etc.

`ScheduleJobAdapters` do not tick schedules by themselves. They're meant to be a wrapper around an object that actually
does so, like a `cron` job, a `setInterval()` interval, to be able to interact with them without actually knowing the
actual implementation, or what's "inside". However because of their nature, they're also implementation-specific.
:::

The schedule system is made up of several objects that work together to track the execution of schedule objects, all
coordinated by a `ScheduleManager`.

Specifically, the schedule related objects are:

* `ScheduleManager`: The entry point for the schedule system, holding all the schedule-related objects and methods that
use all of these objects. All objects below are contained here.
* `ScheduleExecutionScheduler`: Tracks the execution of schedules and stores the `ScheduleJobAdapters`.
* `ScheduleRepository`: Stores all the currently registered schedules.
* `ScheduleExecutor`: Executes schedules, checking its `ScheduleMiddlewareList` and passing any errors to
its `ErrorHandler`.
* `EventBus`: An [üì£ Event Bus](../events/event-bus) that emits schedule related events.

  When the Schedule is added:

  1. A schedule is added via `ScheduleManager#addSchedule()`.
  2. The manager adds the schedule is added to the `ScheduleRepository`.
  3. The manager tells the `ScheduleExecutionScheduler` to create a new `ScheduleJobAdapter` for it.
  4. The `ScheduleManager` uses the `EventBus` to emit a `ScheduleAdd` event asynchronously, passing the added schedule.

  When the job determines that the schedule should be called:

  1. The `ScheduleJobAdapter` tells the `ScheduleExecutor` to execute the schedule.
  2. The `ScheduleExecutor` checks its `ScheduleMiddlewareList` which will allow or deny the execution.
  This includes checking the filter on `Schedule#getFilter()`.
  3. If the execution is allowed, the schedule is called, passing any errors to its `ErrorHandler`.

## ‚ú® Quick examples

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Creating a StatusSchedule">
```

1. Extend `AbstractSchedule`, implementing `tick()` and `interval`.
2. Register it to a bot's `ScheduleManager`.

```ts
class StatusSchedule extends AbstractSchedule {
  // Cron format (every half hour). Can also be a Date or number.
  protected readonly interval = '*/30 * * * *';

  public async tick(meta: ScheduleTickMeta) {
    const bot = meta.getBot();
    const { client } = bot;

    const guildsAmount = client.guilds.cache.size;
    client.user.setActivity(`${guildsAmount} servers`, { type: ActivityType.Watching });
  }
}

const schedule = new StatusSchedule();
await bot.schedules.addSchedule(schedule);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Pausing a Schedule">
```

1. Get the job that ticks the schedule. Either:

* From the `ScheduleExecutionScheduler` via `ScheduleExecutionScheduler#getJobForSchedule()`.
* From the `Schedule`, via `Schedule#getJob()`, passing the bot.
* From the `ScheduleManager` when adding the schedule.

2. Pause the job via `ScheduleJobAdapter#pause()`.

```ts
// One of:
const job = bot.schedules.getScheduler().getJobForSchedule(schedule);
const job = schedule.getJob(bot);
const job = await bot.schedules.addSchedule(schedule);

// Then:
await job.pause();
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
