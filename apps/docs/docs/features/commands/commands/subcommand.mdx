# Ô∏èüß© SubCommand

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Subcommands are executable commands that are stored inside a [`üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Parent Command`](./parent-command) or a [`üóÇÔ∏è SubCommand Group`](./subcommand-group).

:::note
While SubCommands don't depend on a specific bot, they do depend on their parent (`ParentCommand` or `SubCommandGroup`).
:::

## üë∑ Creation

1. Create a subcommand class by either:

* Extending `AbstractSubCommand` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `SubCommand` interface from `@core`.

2. Implement `createData()` that returns the DJS `SlashCommandSubcommandBuilder` that stores the subcommand's data, and `execute()` that executes the subcommand.

3. Add it to a `ParentCommand` or `SubCommandGroup` with `#addChildren()`, or by overriding `children` on its fields.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending AbstractSubCommand">
```

```ts
class MySubCommand extends AbstractSubCommand {
  protected createData() {
    return new SlashCommandSubcommandBuilder()
      .setName('hello')
      .setDescription('Hello world!');
  }

  public async execute(
    interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction,
    meta: CommandExecutionMeta
  ) {
    const bot = meta.getBot();
    const botId = bot.getId();

    await interaction.reply(`Hello from Bot ${String(botId)} from MySubCommand!`);
  }
}

// highlight-start
// The subCommandParent variable is the parent that will contain this subcommand,
// whether a ParentCommand or a SubCommandGroup
const subCommand = new MySubCommand(subCommandParent);
// highlight-end

// warn-start
// Throws IllegalDuplicateError if a child with that name already exists
// Throws RangeError if no more children can be added to this command (25)
// Throws AssertionError if this child's parent is not subCommandParent
subCommandParent.addChildren(subCommand);
// warn-end
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing SubCommand">
```

```ts
class MySubCommand implements SubCommand {
  // ...
}

// highlight-start
// The subCommandParent variable is the parent that will contain this subcommand,
// whether a ParentCommand or a SubCommandGroup
const subCommand = new MySubCommand(subCommandParent);
// highlight-end

// warn-start
// Throws IllegalDuplicateError if a child with that name already exists
// Throws RangeError if no more children can be added to this command (25)
// Throws AssertionError if this child's parent is not subCommandParent
subCommandParent.addChildren(subCommand);
// warn-end
