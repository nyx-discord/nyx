import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

Schedule interception refers to blocking a schedule from being executed. In nyx, there are two ways to do this:

1. Add a `ScheduleMiddleware` to the `ScheduleMiddlewareList` in the `ScheduleExecutor` that handles
the schedule execution.
2. Provide a `ScheduleFilter` in the `Schedule`.

Let's explore when and how to use each of these methods.

## üö¶ Schedule Middlewares

`ScheduleMiddlewares` are objects stored on a `ScheduleMiddlewareList`, which is held and called by
the schedule executor when a schedule is about to be executed.

It consists of:
* A `check()` method, which takes a schedule and its arguments. Returns a `MiddlewareResponse`.
* A `Priority`, that determines its priority inside the list.

When being checked, a middleware is passed the schedule that is being checked and the tick metadata. The schedule then
replies with a `MiddlewareResponse`, which can either:

* Make the list check the next middleware: `{ allowed: true, checkNext: true }`.
* Forcing the execution to end as with an allowed result: `{ allowed: true, checkNext: false }`.
* Deny the execution: `{ allowed: false, checkNext: false }`.

The `AbstractMiddleware`, has `protected` utility methods to generate these responses. Specifically, `this.true()`,
`this.false()` and `this.forceTrue()`.

### ‚ùì When to use a middleware?

Middlewares are best for executing something or intercepting for all schedules. For example, the filtering
(`ScheduleFilter`) logic is done by a middleware.

They're very good when intercepting `Schedules` in general, but not really for one in particular, since it
would be very inefficient to check all the schedules searching for only one of them.

### üë∑‚Äç Middleware Creation

You can create your own middleware by either:

* Extending `AbstractScheduleMiddleware` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `ScheduleMiddleware` interface from `@core`.


```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending AbstractScheduleMiddleware">
```

```ts
import { AbstractScheduleMiddleware } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MyScheduleMiddleware extends AbstractScheduleMiddleware {
  public check(schedule: Schedule, ...args: ScheduleTickArgs): MiddlewareResponse {
    return this.true();
  }
}

const middleware = new MyScheduleMiddleware();

bot.schedules.getExecutor().getMiddleware().add(middleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing ScheduleMiddleware">
```

```ts
import { ScheduleMiddleware } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MyScheduleMiddleware implements ScheduleMiddleware {
  // ...
}

const middleware = new MyScheduleMiddleware();

bot.schedules.getExecutor().getMiddleware().add(middleware);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

By default, the following middleware list is used:

* `ScheduleFilterCheckMiddleware` - See [üöß Schedule Filters](#-Schedule-filters).

## üöß Schedule Filters

An `ScheduleFilter` is a nullable object provided by an `Schedule`, checked by the `ScheduleFilterCheckMiddleware`.

:::info
Filters are not bot aware nor schedule aware, meaning that you can reuse the same instance for many schedules.
:::

:::tip
Think of a filter like adding an `if` at the beginning of your schedule's execution, except it gets checked before the
schedule is executed and, since it's an object, you can reuse it for multiple schedules or save state on it.
:::

Though schedules can only provide one filter, `@framework` provides utility filter aggregators that implement the
basic `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates, that can help you "combine" multiple filters into one.

### ‚ùì When to use a filter?

Filters are best suited for sharing common conditions that multiple schedules should share before executing.

Also, since they have access to the schedule that is being filtered and the `ScheduleExecutionMeta` object, filters can
share information to the schedule, effectively working as a "pre-processor".
